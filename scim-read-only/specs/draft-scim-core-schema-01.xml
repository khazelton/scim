    <abstract>
      <t>The Simple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM) specification is designed
      to make managing user identity in cloud based applications and services
      easier. The specification suite seeks to build upon experience with
      existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on
      simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing
      authentication, authorization, and privacy models. It's intent is to
      reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by
      providing a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding
      documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using standard
      protocols. In essence, make it fast, cheap, and easy to move users in
      to, out of, and around the cloud.</t>

      <t>This document provides a platform neutral schema and extension model
      for representing users and groups. This schemas is intended for exchange
      and use with cloud service providers. Standard serializations of that
      schema using JSON and XML are also provided.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />
      .</t>

      <t>Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
      to be taken literally. When using these values in protocol messages, the

    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
      <t>While there are existing standards for describing and exchanging user
      information, many of these standards can be difficult to implement
      and/or use wire protocols that do not easily traverse firewalls nor
      easily layer onto existing web protocols. As a result, many cloud
      providers provide their own non-standard APIs for managing users within
      their services. This increases both the cost and complexity associated
      with organizations adopting products and services from multiple cloud
      providers as they must perform redundant integration development.
      Similarly, cloud services providers seeking to interoperate with
      multiple application marketplaces or cloud identity providers must be
      redundantly integrated.</t>

      <t>SCIM seeks to simplify this problem through a simple to implement
      specification suite that provides a common user schema and extension
      model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging
      this schema using standard protocols. It draws inspiration and best
      practice, building upon existing user APIs and schemas from a wide
      variety of sources including, but not limited to, existing APIs exposed
      by cloud providers, PortableContacts, and LDAP directory services.</t>

      <t>This document provides a platform neutral schema and extension model
      for representing users and groups. This schemas is intended for exchange
      and use with cloud service providers.Standard serializations of that
      schema using JSON and XML are also provided. Additional binding
      documents provide a standard REST API, as well as use of SCIM schema
      over federation protocols such as SAML and OpenID</t>

    <section anchor="schema_structure" title="SCIM Schema Structure">
      <t>SCIM schema provides a minimal core schema for representing users and
      groups, encompassing common attributes found in many existing deployments
      and schemas.</t>

      <t>Each attribute is defined as either a Singular Attribute, in which
      case there MUST NOT be more than one instance of that field per user, or
      as a Plural Attribute, in which case any number of instances of that
      attribute MAY be present per user. The only exception to this is a
      "schemas" attribute used in representations that lack native support for
      expressing schemas such as JSON. This attribute allows introspection of
      the supported schema version for a SCIM representation as well any
      schema extensions supported by that representation. The 'schemas'
      attribute is an array of strings, and values must by URNs designated by
      the corresponding schema definition.</t>

      <t>SCIM information is formatted using labeled attributes with either
      structured or unstructured string data. Unless otherwise specified, all
      attributes are optional and of type xs:string. All encoding MUST be
      UTF-8. Each attribute label uses camelCase notation. Unless specified,
      all attribute values MUST NOT contain any newline characters (\r or
      \n).</t>

      <t>Each attribute value consists of one of the following types:</t>

      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Simple">A single string attribute which MAY specify a
          REQUIRED data format or allow any string. A simple attribute MAY
          contain Canonical Values specified, in which case Service Providers
          SHOULD try to conform to those values if appropriate, but MAY
          provide alternate string values to represent additional values.</t>

          <t hangText="Complex">A multi-value attribute containing any
          combination of other attributes. Complex attributes are defined by
          listing the child attributes and their types. For most Complex
          Attributes, the value sub-attribute contains the Major Value of that
          attribute (i.e. the primary piece of information described by that
          attribute), and the other attributes provide additional
          meta-data.</t>

          <t hangText="Boolean">A special case of a Simple Attribute with two
          legal values: true and false. Values are case-sensitive.</t>

          <t hangText="DateTime">The attribute value MUST be a valid
          xsd:dateTime (e.g. 2008-01-23T04:56:22Z) values as specified in
            <eref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime">
               section 3.2.7 of the XML Schema Datatypes Specification.
              </eref>.
          </t>

          <t hangText="Binary">The attribute value MUST be encoded as a valid
          xsd:base64Binary value as specified in <eref target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#base64Binary"> section 3.2.16 of the XML Schema
              Datatypes Specification.</eref>.  No binary attributes
            are specified in the core schema, however,
            extended schemas may opt to include images,
            digital signatures and the like.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>Plural Attributes allow for lists of attributes using a special
      complex type. All Plural Attributes, unless otherwise specified, have
      the same three standard sub-attributes:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="value">The primary value of this attribute, e.g. the
          actual e-mail address, phone number, id, URL, etc. Each non-empty
          Plural Attribute value MUST contain at least the value
          sub-attribute, but all other sub-attributes are optional.
          REQUIRED.</t>

          <t hangText="type">The type of attribute for this instance, usually
          used to label the preferred function of the given resource.
          OPTIONAL</t>

          <t hangText="primary">A Boolean value indicating whether this
          instance of the Plural Attribute is the primary or preferred value
          of for this attribute, e.g. the preferred mailing address or primary
          e-mail address. Service Providers MUST NOT mark more than one
          instance of the same Plural Attribute as primary, and MAY choose not
          to mark any attributes as primary, if this information is not
          available. For efficiency, Service Providers SHOULD NOT mark all
          non-primary attributes with primary="false", but should instead omit
          this sub-attribute for all non-primary instances. OPTIONAL</t>

          <t hangText="display">A human readable name, primarily used for
          display purposes where the value is an iopaque or complex type such
          as an id. OPTIONAL</t>
        </list>When returning Plural Attributes, Service Providers SHOULD
      canonicalize the value returned, if appropriate (e.g. for e-mail
      addresses and URLs). Providers MAY return the same value more than once
      with different types (e.g. the same e-mail address may used for work and
      home), but SHOULD NOT return the same (type, value) combination more
      than once per Plural Attribute, as this complicates processing by the
      Consumer.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Schema Extension Model">
      <t>SCIM schema follows an object extension model similar to
      ObjectClasses used in LDAP. Unlike LDAP there is no inheritance model;
      all extensions additive. ( similar to auxiliary objectClasses ) Each
      value indicates additive schema that may exist in a SCIM representation
      as specified by extensions not defined in this suite. Each schema
      extension must identify a canonical URI used to identify the extension.
      Schema Extensions MUST follow the rules of singular and plural attribute
      structured defined in this core schema specification. Schema extensions
      MUST NOT override or redefine any schema defined in this core
      specification. For representations that support expressing schema, the
      native convention MUST be used (For instance, XML Namespace). When the
      the 'schemas' attribute is being used ( as defined in Section N),
      additional URIs MUST be specified in the 'schemas' attribute array.</t>

      <section title="Common Schema Attributes">
        <t>Each resource represented by SCIM (Users, Groups, etc.) implicitly
        includes the following common attributes. These common attributes MUST
        be included in all SCIM resources, including any new resource types
        that may be defined. It it not necessary to designate support for Core
        Schema with a value in the "schemas" attributes ( defined in the next
        section ), as inclusion is implicit and mandatory</t>

            be unique across the Service Provider's entire set of resources.
            It MUST be a stable, non-reassignable identifier that does not
            change when the same resource is returned in subsequent requests.
            The value of the id attribute is always issued by the Service
            Provider and MUST never be specified by the Service Consumer.

                which may include house number, street name, PO BOX, and
                multi-line extended street address information. This attribute

            <t hangText="memberOf">A list of groups that the user belongs to.
              The values are meant to enable expression of common group or role
              based access control models, although no explicit authorization
              model is defined. It is intended that the semantics of group
              membership and any behavior or authorization granted as a result
              of membership are defined by the Service Provider are considered
              out of scope for this specification. This value has NO canonical
              types and removes the standard canonical types. If the SCIM
              Service Provider exposes a Group resource, the value MUST be the
              "id" attribute of the corresponding Group resources to which the
              user belongs. TODO - do we need to provider a human readable name
              here?  OPTIONAL.

              represent a thing the User has. That is, an entitlement is an
              additional right to a thing, object or service. No vocabulary or
              syntax is specified and Service Providers/Consumers are expected
              to encode sufficient information in the value so as to accurately
              and without ambiguity determine what the User has access to. This
              value has NO canonical types though type may be useful as a means
              to scope entitlements. OPTIONAL.
            </t>

            <t hangText="roles">A list of roles for the User that collectively
              represent who the User is; e.g., 'Student', "Faculty". No
              vocabulary or syntax is specified though it is expected that a
              role value is a string or label representing a collection of
              entitlements.  This value has NO canonical types and removes the
              standard canonical types.  OPTIONAL.
